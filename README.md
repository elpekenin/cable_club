# Project description

I dont use this code myself, so I won't actively find/solve issues, I'm just making this to help a friend. However, feel free to post any issue/feature request and I will try and get it done.

Licensing and credits belong to the original authors. Even though I will be adding some work of mine on top of their's, I dont feel like asking for any credit.

Notes:
* This project only targets v20 (for now?)
* Original code, as found on <https://www.pokecommunity.com/threads/v16-v17-v18-v19-v20-v21-cable-club-online-trades-battles.449364/> (as of 29-07-2024) is unzip'ed on `vendor/`, just as a reference.
